# Chatbot Response Templates – Week 3

This document defines example response templates the chatbot will use when answering user questions about disaster damage. These templates guide how information is summarized and presented to users.

---

## 1. Overall Damage Summary for an Area
When a user asks about the overall damage in a region, the chatbot will summarize the dominant damage category and provide a general overview.

Example Response:
"Based on the available aerial imagery, most structures in this area experienced moderate damage, with several locations showing signs of severe impact."

---

## 2. Damage at a Specific Location or Tile
When a user asks about damage at a specific location, the chatbot will return the predicted damage class and confidence score.

Example Response:
"This location was classified as major damage with a confidence score of 0.81."

---

## 3. Pre- and Post-Disaster Comparison
If a user asks how an area changed after the disaster, the chatbot will describe visible differences between pre- and post-disaster imagery.

Example Response:
"Comparison of pre- and post-disaster images shows noticeable structural changes, including roof damage and debris accumulation, indicating increased damage."

---

## 4. Counting Damaged Structures
If a user asks how many structures were affected, the chatbot will provide an approximate count grouped by damage category.

Example Response:
"There are approximately 14 buildings with minor damage and 6 buildings with major damage in this area."

## 5. Handling Uncertainty or Missing Data
If the requested data is unavailable or incomplete, the chatbot will clearly communicate this to the user.

Example Response:
"Damage information for this location is currently unavailable due to missing imagery or incomplete data."
